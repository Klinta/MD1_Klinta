            <h2>Where do Raccoons live?</h2>
            <p>
              Racoons are native to North and Central America, although they
              have been introduced elsewhere and are now present in parts of
              Europe and Asia. Their preferred habitat includes marshes, swamps
              and mangrove or flooded forests, but they are extremely adaptable.
              They are known to inhabit anywhere they have access to water,
              including suburban areas. Likewise, dens can be created in a range
              of places, such as log piles, tree holes, on banks, in ground
              burrows or even in attics.

            <h2>What do Raccoons eat?</h2>
            <p>
              Raccoons are omnivores, so they survive on a flexible diet of meat
              and plant foods. They are opportunistic feeders, so take what they
              can get, usually food that is close to or on the ground. This
              includes things like fruits and nuts, eggs, insects, mammals,
              reptiles, fish, and in suburban areas, rubbish forms part of the
              diet.

            <h2>Are Raccoons colour blind?</h2>
            <p>
              Sight is not particularly important to raccoons. They have poor
              long-distance vision and are thought to be either colour-blind or
              at least poor at distinguishing colour. Other senses make up for
              their poor sight though, with touch being the most sensitive.
